## Welcome to the Revolution

Revolution AI provides consultancy and support for cutting-edge developments. Our expertise covers not just web development but also mobile, desktop and AI development. Society is undergoing a revolution in how it engages with technology. Starting with the internet and the now-ubiquity of computers, change continues to revolutionise how we shop, how we socialise, how we drive, how we think and more. Be at the vanguard of this change in your sector by exploring with us how you can integrate Web, Mobile and AI into your business planning, your customer engagements, and enhance your product offering.

### Business Planning

Decades in the making, there are now more tools than ever to explore how your business is doing, and more importantly what it SHOULD be doing. Picking the wrong path can be a fatal mistake for the company, so let us outline and help you set up the Decision Support Systems which will help you to make better-informed plans to shape your business.

### Customer Engagement

It's no longer good enough to have a polished pitch. You need to make the customer feel you can be trusted and to engage with them in a platform that makes sense to them. We can help you develop your presence and brand, outlining the principles you'll need to follow to build your presence and reinforce your connection with a customer. It's easier than ever for customers to find other options, so you need to make them feel part of your family. We can help provide tools to allow you to gauge levels of interaction from different sources, estimate the impact of different approaches, and help you to refine your approach using in-depth analysis of what you're doing that's working or not working.

### Building Technical Teams

As well as being able to develop a solution, we can provide the technical knowledge to start building a team within your own company. Our projects can be planned with a hand-over phase that allows you to build any technical team you need to progress the project into the future. We don't want to build a short term engagement. We want to help you build the next billion dollar company.
